## TODO
~~1) Get package version running~~

~~2) Write predict function~~

~~3) remove pandas dependency~~

~~4) remove training script~~

~~5) organize repo and source code~~

~~6) Add liscence?~~

~~7) Test CPU version of in python works correctly~~

8) Create/test command line version
9) make pip installable
10) Finish README

## Requirements
 - PyTorch 1.7
